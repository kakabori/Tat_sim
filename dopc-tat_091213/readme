	lipid/Tat  at 310 k 
	Force field is Slipids force field for DOPC and amber force field for Tat. 
	Both force fields are all-atom fields similar to charmm but claim to have better agreement in form factors than charmm.

Comments
	1. I included CL density in the sim file. I don't know if it is a proper way to do. You can take the last colum (which corresponds to CL ) in sim file out to see if it affects form factors. 
	2. The Tat model I choose has charged ends ( that's normally the case for experiments  ). Please check if your Tat in experiment has charged ends too.
