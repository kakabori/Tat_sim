These form factors are created using SIMtoEXP13.

Important note: 
Atomic Form Factors were UNCHECKED (not used). This is because
when this feature is on, F(q) shows some dent and bump in 
the third and higher lobes for Tat simulations. DOPC simulation
does not show such distortion. I suspect that something funny is
going on with this particular feature of the program.
